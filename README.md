AquaSkills Swimming Academy is a fictional swimming club website that offers aqua aerobic classes and swimming lessons for children and adults. Its primary purpose is to attract swimming enthusiasts and get them to book classes and training sessions. The idea of the swimming club project was invented through my previous experience as a swimming athlete and teacher. The website's purpose is educational - benefits of swimming, links to the major swimming organisations and latest events, and commercial-sell service to the audience.
